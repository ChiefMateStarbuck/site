I thought of something on my way home from university today. The thought was beautiful, tranquil, and relaxing. It was complete, strikingly opposed to the other bland and broken ideas that have pervaded and perverted my mind of late.

This thought ... this thought held so many answers, not only for me, but for the global society I find myself in the direct middle of. But ... I forgot it.

I got home, walked into my room, relaxed on my bed, and forgot everything.

# Honestly, I forgot to change the world.
