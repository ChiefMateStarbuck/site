I believe that it takes a certain amount of comfortability within yourself demanded by the solitude – or in many cases, loneliness – of academic study. It is not the difficulty per say, but the constant bombardment of new information that must be digested and regurgitated at such a seemingly never ending pace be excruciating. The material is not hard, and maybe there in lies another problem of the academic venture. It is monotonous, boring, and repetitive. Compiled by the long duration of a semester and the unengaging teaching style most professors adopt only adds to the frustration. There is an energy on the faces of the everyone involved that gives a clairvoyant view of the pain they bear just being involved in the situation. No seems happy, no one seems engaged in their work, all bearing pain that, to the wearers, must be endured rather than fought.

The pain must be fought. It must be attacked with the most supreme tactics of ingenuity and poise, lest the fighter risks losing a war that has not even begun.
