      <description>I believe that it takes a certain amount of comfortability within yourself demanded by the solitude – or in many cases, loneliness – of academic study. It is not the difficulty per say, but the constant bombardment of new information that must be digested and regurgitated at such a seemingly never ending pace be excruciating. The material is not hard, and maybe there in lies another problem of the academic venture.</description>
